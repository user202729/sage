==================================
Welcome to Sage Installation Guide
==================================

If you are reading this manual at https://doc.sagemath.org/, note that
it was built at the time the most recent stable release of SageMath
was made.

More up-to-date information and details regarding supported platforms
may have become available afterwards and can be found in the section
"Availability and installation help" of the
`release tour for each SageMath release <https://github.com/sagemath/sage/releases>`_.

**Where would you like to run SageMath?** Pick one of the following sections.

.. _installation-guide-macos:

macOS
=====

- **Do you want to do SageMath development?**

  - **Yes, development:**

    Obtain the SageMath sources via ``git`` as described in `The Sage
    Developer's Guide
    <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/walkthrough.html#chapter-walkthrough>`_.

    - Then build SageMath from source as described in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-from-sources`.

    - Alternatively, follow the instructions in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-conda-develop`;
      these describe an experimental method that gets all required
      packages, including Python packages, from conda-forge.

  - **No development:**

    - Install the `binary build of SageMath <https://github.com/3-manifolds/Sage_macOS/releases>`_
      from the 3-manifolds project.  It is a signed and notarized app, which
      works for macOS 10.12 and newer. It is completely self-contained and
      provides the standard Sage distribution together with many optional
      packages. Additional optional Python packages can be installed with the
      ``%pip`` magic command and will go into your ``~/.sage`` directory.

    - Alternatively, install SageMath from the `conda-forge
      <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ project, as described in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-conda`.

    - Alternatively, build SageMath from source as described in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-from-sources`.

.. _installation-guide-windows:

Windows
=======

- **Do you want to do SageMath development?**

  - **Yes, development:**

    Enable `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_ and install
    Ubuntu as follows.

    - Make sure that hardware-assisted virtualization is enabled in
      the EFI or BIOS of your system. If in doubt, refer to your
      system's documentation for instructions on how to do this.

    - `Run the WSL install command as administrator.
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#get-started>`_
      This will install Ubuntu Linux.

      Note that the basic instructions in the linked article apply to
      up-to-date installations of Windows 10 and 11, but there are
      also links to the procedures for older builds of Windows 10.

    - If you had installed WSL previously or installed it using
      different instructions, `verify that you are running WSL 2
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#check-which-version-of-wsl-you-are-running>`_.

    - `Set up your Linux username and password.
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password>`_
      Do not include any spaces in your username.

    - If your computer has less than 10GB of RAM, `change the WSL settings
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#main-wsl-settings>`_
      to make at least 5GB of RAM available to WSL.

    Start Ubuntu from the Start menu. Then follow the instructions for
    development on Linux below.

  - **No development:**

    Enable `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/>`_ and install
    Ubuntu as follows.

    - Make sure that hardware-assisted virtualization is enabled in
      the EFI or BIOS of your system. If in doubt, refer to your
      system's documentation for instructions on how to do this.

    - `Run the WSL install command as administrator.
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#get-started>`_
      This will install Ubuntu Linux.

      Note that the basic instructions in the linked article apply to
      up-to-date installations of Windows 10 and 11, but there are
      also links to the procedures for older builds of Windows 10.

    - If you had installed WSL previously or installed it using
      different instructions, `verify that you are running WSL 2
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#check-which-version-of-wsl-you-are-running>`_.

    - `Set up your Linux username and password.
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment#set-up-your-linux-username-and-password>`_
      Do not include any spaces in your username.

    - If your computer has less than 8GB of RAM, `change the WSL settings
      <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#main-wsl-settings>`_
      to make at least 4GB of RAM available to WSL.

    Start Ubuntu from the Start menu, and type the following commands
    to install Sage from conda-forge. (The ``$`` represents the command
    line prompt, don't type it!) The second step will ask a few questions,
    and you may need to hit :kbd:`Enter` to confirm or type ``yes``
    and then hit :kbd:`Enter`.

    .. code-block:: shell

       $ curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
       $ bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
       $ conda create -n sage sage python=3.11

    (If there are any installation failures, please report them to
    the conda-forge maintainers by opening a `GitHub Issue for
    conda-forge/sage-feedstock <https://github.com/conda-forge/sage-feedstock/issues>`_.)

    You can now start SageMath as follows:

    .. code-block:: shell

       $ conda activate sage
       $ sage

    This way of starting Sage gives you the most basic way of using
    Sage in the terminal. See :ref:`sec-launching` for recommended next steps,
    in particular for setting up the Jupyter notebook, which is required if
    you want to use graphics.

.. _installation-guide-linux:

Linux
=====

- **Do you want to do SageMath development?**

  - **Yes, development:**

    Obtain the SageMath sources via ``git`` as described in `The Sage
    Developer's Guide
    <https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/developer/walkthrough.html#chapter-walkthrough>`_.

    - Then build SageMath from source as described in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-from-sources`.

    - Alternatively, follow the instructions in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-conda-develop`;
      these describe an experimental method that gets all required
      packages, including Python packages, from conda-forge.

  - No development: **Do you have root access (sudo)?**

    - **Yes, root access:** Then the easiest way to install SageMath is
      through a Linux distribution that provides it as a package.  Some
      Linux distributions have up-to-date versions of SageMath,
      see `repology.org: sagemath
      <https://repology.org/project/sagemath/versions>`_ for an
      overview.  See :ref:`sec-GNU-Linux` for additional information.

      If you are on an older version of your distribution and a recent
      version of SageMath is only available on a newer version of the
      distribution, consider upgrading your distribution.
      In particular, do not install a version of Sage older than 9.5.

    - **No root access, or on an older distribution:** Install SageMath from
      the `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ project, as described in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-conda`.

    - Alternatively, build SageMath from source as described in section
      :ref:`sec-installation-from-sources`.
